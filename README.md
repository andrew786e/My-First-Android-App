# First Android Project: Counter and Random Number Generator
Welcome to the First Android Project! This is a beginner-friendly Android application designed to demonstrate the basics of fragment communication, navigation, and event handling.
The application features two main fragments: a Counter Fragment for incrementing a numerical value, and a Random Number Generator Fragment that generates a random number based 
on the counter value.

## Features
**Fragment Navigation:** Seamlessly navigate between the Counter Fragment and the Random Number Generator Fragment using Android's Navigation Component.

**Counter Functionality:** Users can increment a numerical count with each button press.

**Random Number Generation:** Generates a random number that considers the current count.

**Data Passing Between Fragments:** Demonstrates passing data from the Counter Fragment to the Random Number Generator Fragment.

**Responsive and User-Friendly UI:** Compatible with different Android devices and screen orientations.
