# First Android Project: Counter and Random Number Generator
Welcome to the First Android Project! This is a beginner-friendly Android application designed to demonstrate the basics of fragment communication, navigation, and event handling.
The application features two main fragments: a Counter Fragment for incrementing a numerical value, and a Random Number Generator Fragment that generates a random number based 
on the counter value.

## Features
**Fragment Navigation:** Seamlessly navigate between the Counter Fragment and the Random Number Generator Fragment using Android's Navigation Component.

**Counter Functionality:** Users can increment a numerical count with each button press.

**Random Number Generation:** Generates a random number that considers the current count.

**Data Passing Between Fragments:** Demonstrates passing data from the Counter Fragment to the Random Number Generator Fragment.

**Responsive and User-Friendly UI:** Compatible with different Android devices and screen orientations.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
1) Android Studio (latest version recommended)
2) Minimum SDK version as specified in the app's build.gradle file

## Installation
1) Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/andrew786e/My-First-Android-App.git
2) Open Android Studio and select "Open an Existing Project". Navigate to the project directory.
3) Let Android Studio set up the project and install any required dependencies.
4) Once the setup is complete, run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

## Usage
### Counter Fragment
1) Displays a number and a button.
2) Each button press increments the counter.
3) Navigate to the Random Number Generator Fragment to see the effect of the current count.

### Random Number Generator Fragment
1) Generates a random number upon navigation.
2) Shows the passed count and the generated random number.
3) Navigate back to the Random Number Fragment.
